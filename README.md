# Prompts 
Apologies for the oversight. Here are all the prompts provided during this session:

Write a Python utility to perform the following.
- The utility shall take a list of filename patterns as required input. At least one filename pattern must be provided.
- The utility shall take a list of directories as required input. Allow wildcards and relative paths in directory names. At least one directory pattern must be provided.
- Allow wildcard in input file and directory names.
- The utility shall recursively scan all the directories and select all the files matching the specified filename patterns.

The utility shall also provide a command-line option for an easy way to specify all the required and optional inputs from a YAML file.
- The utility shall provide help if required inputs are not provided.
- Provide help if an invalid or unsafe filename pattern is provided as input.
- Provide help if an invalid or unsafe directory name is provided as input.
- Do not allow unsafe file and directory names that are considered as system files or part of the operating system or require administrative privilege.

Can you make `if action == "sanitize_filename":` a separate function?

Now I want to add a few more actions. Let's start with `--action=remove_files_with_zero_length` to remove files with zero length.

Now add this action `--action=list_system_files` shall list system files that are considered as unsafe for modifications by unprivileged users.

In the previous step, modify the action to list and report files that are considered as unsafe for modifications by unprivileged users for each of the operating systems such as Windows OS, MacOS, and Linux OS flavors.

Can you improve the list of directories for each operating system?

Let us modify the input validations done by this script and add checks to not allow any directory paths associated with common system directories where sensitive files are often located.

Rename `scan_files()` to say `select_files()` to return matched files. Also, move the `perform_action_on_files(matched_files, action)` to the main higher-level function.

For better readability move this code fragment into a separate function and call it `input_validations()`.

For better readability move `input_validations()`, `select_files()`, `perform_actions()` into separate files.

I am thinking we no longer need the `def list_system_files(files)` option.

If input_validation fails, I want us to provide the help showing the command syntax and an example YAML file. In the example YAML file add comments to clarify that directories with system files are not allowed.

Modify the code so that we can perform multiple actions as specified by their sequence on the command line or in the YAML file.

In the `file_actions` module, assume that each `--action` upon the selected set of file may return a new list of files and the subsequent actions should take that new list of files.

For the `file_actions` module I want to add a new action `--action=remove_duplicates` to detect and remove files with duplicate content. You should provide a dialog listing all the files with duplicate contents and make the user select which file to persist and remove the rest.

Do we also need to modify the `main.py` for this newly added action?

Please provide the complete listing for all the modules, main program, and an example YAML configuration file with appropriate comments.

Can you also list all the prompts i provide to you during this session?

User>
Now could you please take this modular program we just created and teach me step by step how to perform unit testing for each and every  module. Please suggest best possible test framework or testing practices

Certainly! Unit testing is an essential aspect of software development as it helps ensure the correctness of individual components (units) of your code. We'll go through the process of adding unit tests for each module in the program. We'll use the `unittest` framework, which is a built-in testing framework in Python.

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

If you haven't installed `unittest`, you can do so via pip:

```bash
pip install unittest
```

### Step 2: Create a Test Directory

Create a directory named `tests` where we'll place our test files.

### Step 3: Writing Unit Tests for `input_validation.py`

Let's start by writing unit tests for the `input_validation.py` module. We'll create a file named `test_input_validation.py` inside the `tests` directory.

```python
import unittest
from input_validation import is_valid_filename, is_valid_directory, is_safe_directory

class TestInputValidation(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_valid_filename(self):
        self.assertTrue(is_valid_filename("file.txt"))
        self.assertFalse(is_valid_filename("file*.txt"))
        # Add more test cases as needed

    def test_valid_directory(self):
        self.assertTrue(is_valid_directory("/path/to/dir"))
        self.assertFalse(is_valid_directory("/path/to/dir*"))
        # Add more test cases as needed

    def test_safe_directory(self):
        self.assertTrue(is_safe_directory("/path/to/safe/dir"))
        self.assertFalse(is_safe_directory("/path/to/system/dir"))
        # Add more test cases as needed

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### Step 4: Writing Unit Tests for `file_selection.py`

Next, let's write unit tests for the `file_selection.py` module in a file named `test_file_selection.py`.

```python
import unittest
from file_selection import select_files

class TestFileSelection(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_select_files(self):
        files = select_files(["*.txt"], ["/path/to/dir"])
        self.assertTrue(len(files) > 0)
        # Add more test cases as needed

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### Step 5: Writing Unit Tests for `file_actions.py`

Now, let's create unit tests for the `file_actions.py` module in a file named `test_file_actions.py`.

```python
import unittest
from file_actions import sanitize_filename, remove_files_with_zero_length

class TestFileActions(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_sanitize_filename(self):
        # Create test files
        files = ["file 1.txt", "file 2.txt"]
        sanitized_files = sanitize_filename(files)
        self.assertTrue(all(" " not in filename for filename in sanitized_files))

    def test_remove_files_with_zero_length(self):
        # Create test files
        files = ["non_empty_file.txt", "empty_file.txt"]
        # Write content to non-empty file
        with open(files[0], "w") as f:
            f.write("Some content")
        removed_files = remove_files_with_zero_length(files)
        self.assertNotIn("empty_file.txt", removed_files)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### Step 6: Writing Unit Tests for `action_removing_duplicates.py`

Finally, let's write unit tests for the `action_removing_duplicates.py` module in a file named `test_action_removing_duplicates.py`.

```python
import unittest
from action_removing_duplicates import detect_duplicate_files, remove_duplicates

class TestActionRemovingDuplicates(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_detect_duplicate_files(self):
        files = ["file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt", "file4.txt"]
        # Create duplicate files
        for i in range(2):
            with open(f"file{i + 1}.txt", "w") as f:
                f.write("Some content")
        duplicates = detect_duplicate_files(files)
        self.assertTrue(len(duplicates) > 0)

    def test_remove_duplicates(self):
        files = ["file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt"]
        # Create duplicate files
        for i in range(2):
            with open(f"file{i + 1}.txt", "w") as f:
                f.write("Some content")
        new_files = remove_duplicates(files)
        self.assertEqual(len(new_files), 1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### Step 7: Running Tests

To run the tests, navigate to the `tests` directory in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest
```

This command will automatically discover and run all test cases in the test files.

### Step 8: Additional Considerations

- You can add more test cases as needed to cover various scenarios and edge cases.
- Consider mocking external dependencies or using test fixtures to isolate the unit under test.
- Aim for test coverage that ensures all critical paths and logic branches are tested.
- Run tests regularly, ideally as part of your continuous integration (CI) pipeline.

By following these steps, you can effectively test each module of your program using the `unittest` framework. Adjust the tests as needed based on the specific behavior and requirements of your code.
